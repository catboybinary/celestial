# GDD – Celestial, Relics add-on
## Some relic ideas:
- ### Starblazers: Boots, that allow you to travel in a non-conventional way:
  - Generates a star field around the wearer with different constellations
  - **Moonlight** is a form of energy, collected only during nighttime. The fuller the phase of the moon – the higher the recharge rate.
  - The wearer can travel along the **constellation** by clicking on the next star, slowly depleting their moonlight.
  - While the wearer is moving along the constellation, they become invincible and ghost-like (the collisions are disabled)
  - If the wearer reaches the end of a constellation, they can perform a warp jump to an another constellation, depleting their moonlight drastically.
  - Upgradeable stats:
    - Moonlight capacity
    - Movement speed
  - Unlockable abilities:
    - **5⚝ – [Sun and Moon]:** Allows the wearer to slowly regenerate Moonlight during daytime, hence making the relic usable even when the sun is up.
